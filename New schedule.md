# Current tatu schedule

## Week 7 & 8 - Badly working networking

### Week 7 (would be good)

- Bullet and player collisions (Attila)
- UDP low level (Milan)
- Networking interfaces - Input, Connect request - Connect response, GameState messages (Milan) (+ priority, Reconcilation dependency)
- ~~Entity Management - create, destroy, update, draw, manage with id~~ (Daniel)
- ~~Decouple rendering and input from entities~~ (Daniel)

### Week 8

- Basic game logic - Power ups, Bullet - Player hit detecton (Attila)
- Rendering + extra graphic work (Attila)
- Input -> Networking (Milan)
- Basic client-server reconcilation algorithm (jump to latest server response) (Daniel)

## Further development

### Week 9 - Client side - server side prediction

### Week 10 - Lag compensation + missing game features w/o Asteroids

### Week 11 - Extensive network and play testing => recoding parts + Asteroids

### Week 12 - Optimizing the game and the network algorithm
